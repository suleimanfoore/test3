# Community Playbooks

This is the 5.0 branch of the Splunk SOAR Community Playbooks repository, which contains the default initial playbooks and custom functions for each Splunk SOAR instance. Splunk SOAR was previously known as Phantom. For older versions of Phantom there are other branches such as [4.10](https://github.com/phantomcyber/playbooks/tree/4.10) and [4.9](https://github.com/phantomcyber/playbooks/tree/4.9)

The Splunk SOAR platform automatically links to the branch of this repository that matches the running Splunk SOAR version. By default this repository is named **community**, which can be selected as the **Repo** filter to only display these playbooks and custom functions. You can update your content with the **Update from source control** button on the playbook listing page.
